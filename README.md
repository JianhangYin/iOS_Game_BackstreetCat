# BackstreetCat
This game is now available on apple store! Check more details on my personal website: www.jianhang.space

BackstreetCats is a game for the people who are too busy to spend  a lot of time on the phone games. The only thing you need to do is to leave the food (fish, soup, sushi, and pudding) along the backstreet. After two hours, there will be a cat attracted by the delicious food. After you make friend with it, you will obtain a random food automatically. In this game, different food will attract different cat. Letâ€™s feed the lovely kitten and enjoy the happy time with them!
